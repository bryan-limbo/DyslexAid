# DyslexAid - HackCamp Edition

As part of a beginner-friendly hackathon, HackCamp, it revolved around three main themes: accessibility, diversity, and inclusivity.

After researching about how we could enhance accessibility and inclusivity, we found out that over 780 million people world wide suffer from dyslexia, without a proper tool to help them navigate through what is a heavily digitalized world. We decided to change that, by creating a Google Chrome extension that allows users to customize the fonts, font size, word/line spacing and the line height, enabling the user to have the smoothest experience navigating the internet.

We built this chrome extension using CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Figma, and Adobe Illustrator.
