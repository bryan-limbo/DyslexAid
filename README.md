## DyslexAid 

As part of a beginner-friendly hackathon, HackCamp, it revolved around three main themes: accessibility, diversity, and inclusivity. 

### Objective

After researching about how we could enhance accessibility and inclusivity, we found out that over 780 million people world wide suffer from dyslexia, without a proper tool to help them navigate through what is a heavily digitalized world. We decided to change that, by creating a Google Chrome extension that allows users to customize the fonts, font size, word/line spacing and the line height, enabling the user to have the smoothest experience navigating the internet.

### Tools

We built this chrome extension using CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Figma, and Adobe Illustrator.

### Contributions

Project made by: Joshua Lim, Bryan Lim, Bryan Park, and Minah Park

We only had 12 hours to work on it so it is a prototype, but we are proud of what we were able to accomplish within a specified time frame!
